# Doctor's Appointment Platform - 100-Second Interview Script

## **Spoken Script (Approximately 100 seconds)**

---

**"I built a comprehensive telemedicine platform that connects patients with verified doctors for video consultations. Here's what makes it unique:**

**First, it's a credit-based economy system. Instead of traditional payments, patients subscribe to monthly plans - Free with 2 credits, Standard with 10, or Premium with 24 credits. Each 30-minute appointment costs exactly 2 credits, creating predictable pricing.**

**The platform uses enterprise-grade Vonage Video API for real-time consultations. What's special is that video sessions are pre-created during booking, not at call time, with secure token-based access control and time-based expiration.**

**I implemented sophisticated scheduling with advanced conflict detection. The system prevents double-booking using complex overlap algorithms and generates dynamic 30-minute slots across a rolling 4-day window.**

**The architecture is production-ready with Next.js 15, Prisma ORM, and Clerk authentication. It features a complete admin workflow for doctor verification, payout management, and platform oversight.**

**Doctors earn $8 per appointment while the platform takes $2 - a transparent 80-20 revenue split. The financial system includes complete transaction auditing, payout requests, and PayPal integration.**

**Key technical highlights include database transactions for ACID compliance, role-based access control, comprehensive error handling, and 15 medical specialty categories.**

**This demonstrates expertise in full-stack development, real-time systems, financial transaction management, and enterprise-grade security - making it significantly more sophisticated than typical appointment booking applications."**
